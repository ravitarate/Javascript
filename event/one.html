    For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and
    nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation
    organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries.
    At every level, we collaborate with people around 
    the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions
    that protect communities, wildlife, and the places
    in which they live.
